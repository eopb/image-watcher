# `image-watcher`

## What is it

`image-watcher` is a CLI tool that "compiles" high-resolution images to low-resolution ones.
It also has the option to "watch" source images for changes and update the low-resolution images with these changes.

## Why did I make it

I was developing a static website that used Pug and SASS to generate HTML and CSS.
I needed to find a way to, in a somewhat automated way, form low-resolution images from the high-resolution images in the repository.
I could not find a program that offered a simple solution to my problem so I made my own program.
